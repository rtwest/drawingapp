1. What to do with gallery view? 
	Easy thing - custom gallery in localStorage/SQLite - OR - dump into cameral roll and forget it.  
	Right thing - use cameral roll and save file path for app gallery
	Hack - do both but keep them separate.


Tables
----------
PARENT RECORD: parent_id, displayname, emailaddress
KID RECORD: kid_id, displayname, parent_id, profileimage, registration_code, status
FRIEND RECORD: kid_id1, kid_id2
INVITATION RECORD: from_parent_id, from_kid_id, to_parent_id, to_kid_id, status, datetime
COMMENT RECORD: picture_id, from_kid_id, to_kid_id, comment_content, datetime
PICTURE RECORD: picture_id, kid_id, datetime
SHARE RECORD: picture_id, from_kid_id, to_kid_id






CREATING A NEW INVITATION
1. enter parent email and lookup to verify
2. enter the kids display name and lookup to verify
3. default to the display of the kid whose context you're creating the invitation in
4. create new invitation record with the 4 corresponding IDs


STORAGE ON DEVICE
 - localStorage has 10mb limit.  SQLite is around 50mb.  Use 'lawnchair.js' for this with IndexedDB
 - Lawnchair or IDBWrapper?
 - Put methods in Global Service - test by creating the db.  Should creating it go in service? test and check duplication.
 	Set up Lawnchair in Service and wrap it functions to pass through to them?
 - check that methods are exposed as expected in another controller
 


 REGISTERING THE CLIENT DEVICE WITH PARENT DEVICE
 - On Parent device, create kid record with Display_Name. This creates a record with a generated Registration_Code and Status of "pending"
 - On Client device, after splash screen, enter kid Display_Name and matching Registration_Code.  When verified, change Status
